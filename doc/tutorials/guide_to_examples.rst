PETSc Tutorials
===============

PETSc has many tutorial examples, found in ``tutorials/``
directories throughout the ``src/`` tree. Since these do not have informative
names and vary greatly in their complexity and level of internal documentation,
this page provides guides to connect the tutorial examples to particular physics,
discretizations, solvers, etc. that you might be interested in.
