.. important::

   Do not send configure and installation questions to the petsc-users mailing
   list. Always send them (and include ``configure.log`` and ``make.log``) to
   petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov. See bug-report :ref:`documentation <doc_creepycrawly>` for
   more information.

For all other contact, we have the following mailing lists with public archives for
general use.

.. note::

   - petsc-announce is an announcement only list (i.e users cannot post on this list).
   - petsc-users and petsc-dev are subscriber-only lists (i.e to post to this list - you
     have to subscribe first).
   - All lists have limits on message sizes - so if you have to send in attachments - most
     likely the appropriate place is petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov - not the mailing list.
   - The mailing lists are migrated from majordomo to mailman in Jan-09. So links to
     archives, and subscription procedures have changed since then - as indicated above.

.. [#] This is mostly for PETSc developers, but is by no means a requirement. This mailing
       list is also relevant for those who are interested in the development process of
       PETSc.
