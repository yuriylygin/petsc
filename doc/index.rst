.. admonition:: News: petsc4py Support

  Source code for `petsc4py <https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc4py-current/docs/>`__, developed by Lisandro Dalcin, is now distributed with the PETSc source and supported by the PETSc team and mailing lists.

PETSc, pronounced PET-see (`/ˈpɛt-siː/ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English#Key>`__), is a suite of
data structures and routines for the scalable (parallel) solution of scientific
applications modeled by partial differential equations. It supports MPI, and GPUs through
CUDA or OpenCL, as well as hybrid MPI-GPU parallelism. PETSc (sometimes called PETSc/Tao)
also contains the Tao optimization software library.

PETSc is developed as :ref:`open-source <doc_license>`, requests and contributions are welcome.
